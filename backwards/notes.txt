Big optimalizations:
1. Merging all Phases so we don't work a lot of duplicate
2. The way we generate the graph is very inefficient
3. Simulate_branch and Simulate_TM func are super inefficient. (+ naive simulation)
4. Add option to skip a TM once we know at least one branch can't be verified in depth limit.
5. Start based on known data from a given folder. (Do this AFTER merging phases)
params:
python stronger_backwards.py --phases 2 --stepc_lim 2500000 --history True --DEPTH 100

TODO:
Besides improving upon terms of speed
1. Phase 2
2. Phase 3
3. param to set a given list of configs as visited in forwards-simulation
(given in a seperate file forwards-configs.txt) where TM (in machines.txt) |-> line |-> forwards_config (list)
4. "time" param, max time spent per TM
5. Phase 4 (needs more theory work)
6. Rewrite in C++

Results:
Only Phase 1:
BB(3,3), BB(2,5), BB(6,2) no holdouts solved
BB(7,2) ran on a small subset, all known nonhalters, 4 verified out of 255
