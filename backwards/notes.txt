increment_depth.py can be greatly improved upon in terms of speed
-> graph is redundant

simulate_branch.py and simulate_tm.py can be greatly improved upon in terms of speed.

params:
python stronger_backwards.py --phases 2 --stepc_lim 2500000 --history True --DEPTH 100

TODO:
Besides improving upon terms of speed
1. Phase 3
2. Phase 4 (needs more theory work)
3. "time" param, max time spent per TM

Results:
Without Phase 2
BB(3,3), BB(2,5), BB(6,2) no holdouts solved
BB(7,2) ran on a small subset, all known nonhalters, 4 verified out of 255
